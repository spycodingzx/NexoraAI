# 🧪 Reliability Features Testing Guide

## ✅ Pre-Test Verification Complete

All features have been **triple-checked** and verified:
- ✅ All imports correct
- ✅ All methods callable
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ No circular imports
- ✅ Streamlit compatible
- ✅ Error handling in place

## 🎯 What to Test

### 1. API Validation (Settings Sidebar)

**Location:** Sidebar → Settings Tab → 🔑 API Keys

**Test Steps:**
1. Open the core: `streamlit run nova_system.py`
2. Click sidebar → Settings tab → API Keys
3. You should see 4 API sections with test buttons:
   - 🤖 Replicate API
   - 🖨️ Printify API  
   - 🧠 Anthropic Claude
   - 🛒 Shopify

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Each API shows last 12 chars of token (if configured)
- ✅ "🔌 Test" button appears next to configured APIs
- ✅ Click test button → See success (✅) or error (❌) message
- ✅ "🔌 Test All Connections" button at bottom
- ✅ Click Test All → Tests all configured APIs and shows results

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Test buttons visible
- [ ] Click test button shows real-time feedback
- [ ] Valid token shows "✅ Connected successfully"
- [ ] Invalid token shows "❌" with helpful error message
- [ ] Test All button specs all APIs sequentially

### 2. Automatic Retry (Campaign Generator)

**Location:** Main Tabs → 🎯 Campaign Creator

**Test Steps:**
1. Fill out campaign form with your product details
2. Click "🚀 Generate Complete Campaign!"
3. Watch the progress

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ If API call fails temporarily, it automatically retries
- ✅ Retries 3 times with 2s, 4s, 8s delays
- ✅ If timeout occurs, falls back from Claude to faster Llama model
- ✅ No silent failures - you see what's happening

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Campaign generation completes successfully
- [ ] If network hiccup occurs, see retry messages in logs
- [ ] Campaign eventually succeeds even with transient failures
- [ ] No need to manually restart on temporary errors

### 3. Progress Tracking (Future Enhancement)

**Note:** Progress tracking infrastructure is in place but not yet fully integrated into UI. This will be added in next phase.

### 4. State Management (Background Feature)

**Note:** Autosave runs automatically in background. You won't see it directly, but it's working to protect your data.

## 🐛 What to Watch For

### Expected (Normal):
- ⚠️ "Missing ScriptRunContext" warnings in console - **IGNORE** these, they're normal
- ℹ️ If nv_validation module fails to load, test buttons won't appear but core still works

### Unexpected (Report These):
- ❌ App crashes when clicking test button
- ❌ Test button does nothing (no success/error message)
- ❌ Campaign generation fails without retry
- ❌ Import errors on startup
